This program finds the smallest number of operations needed to make all integers in a list equal. Each operation can 
reduce a number by 1, 2, or 5. The algorithm works by finding the minimum value in the list and trying different target 
levels slightly below it (since sometimes going lower gives fewer steps). It calculates how many operations each element 
needs to reach that target, then keeps the smallest total number of operations as the final answer.
