The program calculates a modified Fibonacci sequence where each term is found using the formula **Tn = Tn-2 + (Tn-1)Â²** instead 
of simple addition. It starts with the given first two numbers, stores them in an array, and keeps computing the next terms until 
it reaches the nth one. Since the numbers can get very large, it uses **BigInteger** to handle big values, and the final computed 
term is printed as the result.
