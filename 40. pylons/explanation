This program decides where to place power plants (pylons) so that every city gets electricity using the fewest pylons possible. 
Each pylon can supply power to itself and nearby cities within range k-1. The program moves from left to right, always placing 
a pylon at the farthest possible city that can cover the current area. If no city can have a pylon, it returns -1. The final 
count shows how many pylons are needed.
