This program finds the largest possible sums from a list of numbers in two ways. The first is the **maximum subarray sum**, 
which looks for the biggest total from continuous numbers in the list, and the second is the **maximum subsequence sum**, 
which adds up the positive numbers or takes the biggest single number if all are negative. It uses a loop to check each 
number and update the best sums, then outputs both results together.
