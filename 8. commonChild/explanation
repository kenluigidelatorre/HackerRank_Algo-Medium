This program finds the longest sequence of letters that appear in the same order in both strings. 
It compares the two strings letter by letter and keeps track of matching parts using a table. If 
two letters match, it adds one to the count; if they don’t, it keeps the longer match found so far. 
In the end, it gives the length of the longest common sequence — called the common child.
