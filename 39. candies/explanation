This program distributes candies to children based on their ratings.
Each child gets at least one candy. If a childâ€™s rating is higher than the one before, they get more candies.
The code first moves left to right to handle increasing ratings, then right to left to adjust for decreases.
Finally, it adds up all the candies to get the total number needed.
