This program finds the minimum number of transmitters needed to cover all houses in Hackerland. It works by first sorting the house positions, 
then starting from the first uncovered house. It moves forward to find the farthest house that can be reached within the transmitterâ€™s range 
(k) and places the transmitter there. After that, it skips all houses already covered by that transmitter and repeats the process until all 
houses are covered. This ensures every house is within range while using the fewest transmitters possible.
