This program finds how many different combinations of unique natural numbers can be raised to a given power to exactly equal a target number. 
The powerSum function starts the process by calling countWays, which uses recursion to explore all possible numbers. For each number, it checks 
if its power is equal to, less than, or greater than the remaining value needed to reach the target. If it matches, that’s one valid combination. 
If it’s smaller, the program tries two paths—one where the number is included and one where it’s skipped. This continues until all possibilities 
are checked, and the total count of valid combinations is returned.
