This program calculates how many solid walls can be built using Lego blocks of length 1 to 4. It first figures 
out all possible combinations for a single row, then raises these to the power of the number of rows to get total 
wall combinations. Next, it removes “unstable” walls that can break apart vertically, keeping only solid ones. 
The result is given modulo 1,000,000,007 to keep numbers manageable.
