This program calculates how many different ways you can make a total amount n using a set of coin values. 
It uses a dynamic programming approach where each coin is used to update a table (dp) that tracks the number 
of combinations to reach every amount up to n. For each coin, it adds the number of ways to make smaller 
amounts leading up to that total. In the end, dp[n] holds the total number of ways to make change for n using 
the given coins.
