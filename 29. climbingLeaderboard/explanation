The program determines each player’s rank based on their scores compared to the existing leaderboard. It first 
removes duplicate scores to keep only unique rankings. Then, for each player’s score, it compares from the lowest 
rank upward to find where the score fits. After each check, it records the player’s current rank, showing how their 
position changes after every game.
