This program turns a given numeric string into the largest possible palindrome using a limited number of digit changes. It first 
checks both ends of the string and changes the smaller digit so that they match, ensuring it becomes a palindrome while counting 
how many changes are used. Then, if there are remaining changes, it upgrades digits to ‘9’ from both ends to make the number as 
large as possible. If it’s impossible to form a palindrome within the allowed number of changes, it returns “-1.”
