This program converts digital time into words. It first stores the number words from one to twenty-nine, including "quarter" and "half". 
Depending on the value of m, it checks for cases like “o’clock”, “quarter past”, “half past”, or “quarter to”. For minutes less than 30, 
it says “minutes past hour”, and for those greater than 30, it says “minutes to next hour”, accurately expressing the time in natural language.
