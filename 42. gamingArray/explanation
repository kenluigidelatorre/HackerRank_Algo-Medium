In this problem, two players — Bob and Andy — take turns removing elements from the array. Each time, they remove numbers from 
the end until they reach the current largest number. The game ends when all numbers are gone. The player who makes the last move 
wins. The program counts how many times a new maximum number appears while scanning the array. If the count is odd, Bob wins; if 
even, Andy wins.
