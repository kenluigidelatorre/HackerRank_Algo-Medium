This program counts how many pairs of numbers in a list have a difference equal to a given value k. It stores all 
numbers in a HashSet for quick searching, then checks for each number if another number exists that is exactly k 
greater. Every time such a pair is found, the counter increases. For example, if the input is 5 2 and the numbers 
are 1 5 3 4 2, the valid pairs are (1,3), (2,4), and (3,5), so the output is 3.
