The program calculates how many squares a queen can attack on a chessboard of size n × n, given her position and some 
obstacles that block her path. The queen moves in eight possible directions — vertically, horizontally, and diagonally — 
until she either reaches the edge of the board or an obstacle. The program first stores all obstacle positions in a hash
set for fast checking. Then, for each of the eight directions, it moves step by step from the queen’s position, increasing 
the count of attackable squares until blocked. After checking all directions, the total count represents how many squares 
the queen can attack.
