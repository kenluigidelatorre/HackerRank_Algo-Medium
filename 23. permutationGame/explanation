This program simulates a two-player game where Alice and Bob take turns removing elements from an array. The goal is to make the array sorted; 
whoever does that loses. The code uses recursion and memoization to check every possible move. For each turn, it removes one number and checks 
if the next player will lose. If there’s a move that forces the opponent to lose, that’s a winning position. In the end, the program prints 
"Alice" if the first player can win, or "Bob" if not.
