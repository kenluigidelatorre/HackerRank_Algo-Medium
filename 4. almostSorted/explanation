The program checks if a list of numbers can be sorted by doing just one simple move — either swapping two numbers or 
reversing a section of the list. It compares the given list to its sorted version to find where the numbers are out of 
order. If only two positions are wrong, swapping them will fix it. If more are wrong but reversing that part makes it 
sorted, that also works. If neither works, it means the list can’t be fixed in one move.
