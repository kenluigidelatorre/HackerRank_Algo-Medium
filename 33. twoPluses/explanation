This program looks for all possible plus shapes made of 'G' cells in the grid. For each good cell, it tries to expand arms equally in 
all directions to form larger pluses. It saves all valid pluses, then compares every pair to check if they overlap. If they donâ€™t, it 
multiplies their areas and keeps track of the highest product. Finally, it prints that maximum product, representing the two biggest 
non-overlapping pluses in the grid.
