The program finds the largest subset of numbers where the sum of any two numbers is not divisible by k. It does this 
by counting how many numbers have each possible remainder when divided by k. For example, if k = 3, possible remainders 
are 0, 1, and 2. Numbers that leave the same remainder canâ€™t all be chosen freely, because some pairs might sum to a 
multiple of k. The program keeps at most one number with remainder 0, then for every pair of remainders (i, k - i), 
it includes whichever group is larger. If k is even, it also allows one number from the remainder exactly equal to k/2. 
The final count gives the size of the largest valid subset.
