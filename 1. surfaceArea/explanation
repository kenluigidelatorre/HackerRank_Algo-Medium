This program calculates the total surface area of 3D blocks stacked in a grid. Each cell value represents the height of blocks. 
The top and bottom faces always add to the total area, and for the sides, it checks how much of each face is exposed by comparing 
the height difference between neighboring cells. The sum of all exposed faces gives the total surface area.
