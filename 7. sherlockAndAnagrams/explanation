This program finds how many pairs of substrings in a given string are anagrams of each other. It works by checking every possible 
substring of the string, sorting the letters in each substring, and then comparing them. If two substrings have the same sorted 
letters, they are anagrams. The program counts all such pairs and prints the total number of anagram pairs found.
