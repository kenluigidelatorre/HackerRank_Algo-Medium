This program finds the smallest possible loss when selling a house at a lower price than it was bought for. It works by keeping track of 
each priceâ€™s original position, sorting all prices, and comparing only adjacent prices in the sorted list. For each pair, it checks if 
the higher price appeared earlier in the input (which means it was bought first). Among all valid pairs, it picks the smallest difference 
as the minimum loss.
