The program calculates the maximum profit you can make from buying and selling stocks on given days. It scans the prices from 
right to left, always keeping track of the highest price seen so far. Whenever a dayâ€™s price is lower than that future max price, 
it means you can buy on that day and sell later at the max price, adding the profit difference.
