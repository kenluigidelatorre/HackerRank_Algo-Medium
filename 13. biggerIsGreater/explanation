This program finds the next lexicographically greater word that can be formed from the given string’s letters. 
It works by finding the first character (from right to left) that can be swapped to make the word larger, then 
swapping it with the smallest character to its right that is still greater, and finally reversing the order of 
the remaining characters after that position. If no such rearrangement is possible because the word is already 
the largest order (like “cba”), it outputs “no answer”.
