This program calculates the minimum total cost of buying flowers when each purchase makes future flowers more expensive. 
It sorts the flower prices from highest to lowest so the most expensive ones are bought first, which helps reduce the total 
cost. Each friend takes turns buying flowers, and every time all friends have bought one flower each, the price multiplier 
increases. This way, the program ensures the total amount spent is as small as possible.
